## Before Getting Started 

Before getting started, it is best to consult [basics](https://github.com/alexandrova-lab-ucla/GroupWiki/tree/master/guides) section of the Wiki. You should have at least a cursory familiarity with bash and Vim commands in order to understand the guides and input files. Additionally, you should know how to access the HPCs using ssh with your (unique) username, password, and potentially MFA token. If you have none of these, speak to a member of the group or Anastassia to get started.
